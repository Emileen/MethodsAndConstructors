## Description

Let's write some code! But first, enjoy this gif of a bird stealing chips.

Okay, back to work.

For each of the classes you made yesterday, write constructors, setters, and getters.

## Requirements
* In each class, write a constructor that sets all of its fields.
* In each class, write setters and getters for all of its fields.
* In each class, make at least one setter method contain an `if` statement that makes it enforce some kind of constraint.

**HARD MODE**
* Create a `CustomMath` class that contains static methods to calculate
  * The area of a circle (given a radius)
  * The length of a hypotenuse on a right triangle

**RIDICULOUS MODE**
* Come up with at least one readonly static field in one of the classes that you specified
* Omit the out/ directory from source control.
